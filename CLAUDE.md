Doc map: SRS is the authoritative **WHAT**. `architecture-and-roadmap.md` is
the **HOW + WHEN**. `decisions.md` is the **WHY**. `personas.md` is
**WHO**. `use-cases.md` is **HOW THEY USE IT** (workflows + UX patterns).
`user-stories.md` is the **BACKLOG** (story-by-story, phase-by-phase).
`glossary.md` is the **DOMAIN VOCABULARY**. `risks.md` is **WHAT COULD GO
WRONG**. `acceptance-criteria.md` is **WHAT "DONE" LOOKS LIKE** per phase.
The previous public-tracker product plan was retired in the 2026-05-28 SRS
pivot — see `decisions.md` "Superseded" section for the carried-over
rationale.

## Current phase
Phase 0 (foundation scaffold) complete: React + Vite + Cesium globe runs
locally with day/night terminator. **Phase 1 next:** stand up the Java/Spring
backend + PostgreSQL + Docker Compose dev env; reshape the frontend shell from
catalog-browser to scenario-shell.

## Stack
- **Frontend:** React + TS strict + Vite + CesiumJS (global view) + three.js
  (proximity view, new in Phase 4).
- **Frontend state:** Zustand, per-slice subscriptions. UI/control state only —
  ephemeris lives in stream buffers.
- **Backend:** Java + Spring Boot.
- **Propagation:** Orekit — SGP4, high-fidelity numerical (DP8(7), J4+, drag,
  SRP, third-body), Clohessy-Wiltshire. Per-scenario fidelity. Deterministic.
- **Persistence:** PostgreSQL (`jsonb` scenario bodies, versioned, audit log).
- **Streaming:** REST (OpenAPI 3.x) + WebSocket (CZML for global view,
  compact relative-state for proximity view).
- **Deployment:** containerized; Docker Compose for dev; cloud + on-prem.

## Architecture rules
- Frontend never propagates; all physics lives behind the streaming contract.
  See Decision 9.
- Every state vector carries a frame tag; all conversions go through one
  canonical utility wrapping Orekit's frames. See Decision 12.
- One authoritative simulation clock — frontend owns playback control,
  backend is authoritative on state. See Decision 11.
- Backend serves **two modes**: a shared catalog stream (one SGP4 pass over
  all ~14,500 active sats, broadcast to every viewer) and per-user scenario
  streams (≤10 spacecraft, selected fidelity). See Decision 13.
- Scenario data model is **chief + deputies**. The catalog browser is the
  primary composition path (click satellite → add to scenario). See
  Decisions 13, 14.
- Build professional-grade from day one — auth pipeline real (stub
  initially), `scenario.owner` exists from the first migration, scenario
  mutations go through one service layer, propagation is deterministic
  (seeded + pinned). See Decision 16.
- TypeScript strict mode on. Never disable.
- Per-slice Zustand subscriptions.

## Conventions
- Ask before adding dependencies.
- Commit after each working feature.
- Tag frame in code wherever state vectors live (names, types, comments):
  `ECI` / `ECEF` / `LVLH` / `RIC` / `body`.

## Build commands

### Full stack (Docker Compose)
- `docker compose up -d --build` — backend + Postgres + frontend (build on first run).
- `docker compose down` — stop services (preserves db volume).
- `docker compose down -v` — stop and wipe db.
- Backend: http://localhost:8081  ·  Frontend: http://localhost:5174
  (host ports 8080 / 5173 are taken by other services on this shared box).

### Frontend (`frontend/`)
- `npm run dev` — Vite dev server on port 5173 (inside container; 5174 from host).
- `npm run type-check` — `tsc --noEmit`.
- `npm run gen:api` — regenerate the OpenAPI client from the running backend.

### Backend (`backend/`) — Gradle, Spring Boot 3.5, Java 21
- `./gradlew bootRun` — start backend locally (requires local JDK 21 + a Postgres reachable at $DB_URL).
- `./gradlew build` — full build incl. tests.
- `./gradlew build -x test` — build without tests (faster, no DB needed).
- Set `JAVA_HOME=$HOME/jdk-21.0.11+10` and prepend to `PATH` (already in `~/.bashrc`).

### Stack (TBD — Phase 1)
- `docker compose up` — full local dev environment (frontend + backend + db).
