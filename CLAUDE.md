Doc map: SRS is the authoritative **WHAT**. `architecture-and-roadmap.md` is
the **HOW + WHEN**. `decisions.md` is the **WHY**. `personas.md` is
**WHO**. `use-cases.md` is **HOW THEY USE IT** (workflows + UX patterns).
`user-stories.md` is the **BACKLOG** (story-by-story, phase-by-phase).
`glossary.md` is the **DOMAIN VOCABULARY**. `risks.md` is **WHAT COULD GO
WRONG**. `acceptance-criteria.md` is **WHAT "DONE" LOOKS LIKE** per phase.
The previous public-tracker product plan was retired in the 2026-05-28 SRS
pivot — see `decisions.md` "Superseded" section for the carried-over
rationale.

## Current phase
**Phase 2 complete** (backend + wiring; one browser-visual check outstanding).
On top of Phase 1's dual-container dev env:
- **Orekit 13.1.5** propagation core: SGP4 via `TLEPropagator`, `FrameService`
  (ECI/ECEF/geodetic, frame-tagged `StateVector`), OMM→TLE conversion. The
  reachable catalog mirrors serve OMM JSON (no TLE lines), so `TleFactory`
  builds TLEs from mean elements (ndot/nddot=0; SGP4 ignores them).
- **Catalog mode** (Decision 13): loads a bundled offline TLE seed (~15.5k
  sats) + best-effort GitHub-mirror refresh (CelesTrak is firewall-blocked
  here), propagates the whole set every 30 s, broadcasts one shared CZML feed
  over WebSocket `/stream/catalog`. ~100–650 ms/pass, 7.36 MB/message.
- **Streaming contract v1** (docs/streaming-contract.md): JSON envelope +
  CZML; ECEF/FIXED positions; `contractVersion` checked client-side (R12).
- **Frontend**: `CatalogStreamClient` → `CzmlDataSource` on the globe;
  click-to-inspect (hit-padded, live position), constellation filters
  (name-prefix; localStorage), search-to-fly, live stats. satellite.js +
  client-side propagation/fetch removed.
- Data bundles (orekit-data + TLE seed) baked into the backend image; fully
  offline-capable. Backend at :8081, frontend at :5174 (8080/5173 taken).

Outstanding: browser FPS + visual click/filter at ~15.5k dots (R7 — if under
30 fps, fall back from the CZML Entity layer to a PointPrimitiveCollection).

**Phase 3 next:** high-fidelity numerical propagation (DP8(7), J4+, drag, SRP,
third-body), LVLH/RIC frames, scenario CRUD + persistence, and wiring the
composer's Set-as-chief / Add-as-deputy actions. See
[docs/architecture-and-roadmap.md §7](docs/architecture-and-roadmap.md).

## Stack
- **Frontend:** React + TS strict + Vite + CesiumJS (global view) + three.js
  (proximity view, new in Phase 4).
- **Frontend state:** Zustand, per-slice subscriptions. UI/control state only —
  ephemeris lives in stream buffers.
- **Backend:** Java + Spring Boot.
- **Propagation:** Orekit — SGP4, high-fidelity numerical (DP8(7), J4+, drag,
  SRP, third-body), Clohessy-Wiltshire. Per-scenario fidelity. Deterministic.
- **Persistence:** PostgreSQL (`jsonb` scenario bodies, versioned, audit log).
- **Streaming:** REST (OpenAPI 3.x) + WebSocket (CZML for global view,
  compact relative-state for proximity view).
- **Deployment:** containerized; Docker Compose for dev; cloud + on-prem.

## Architecture rules
- Frontend never propagates; all physics lives behind the streaming contract.
  See Decision 9.
- Every state vector carries a frame tag; all conversions go through one
  canonical utility wrapping Orekit's frames. See Decision 12.
- One authoritative simulation clock — frontend owns playback control,
  backend is authoritative on state. See Decision 11.
- Backend serves **two modes**: a shared catalog stream (one SGP4 pass over
  all ~14,500 active sats, broadcast to every viewer) and per-user scenario
  streams (≤10 spacecraft, selected fidelity). See Decision 13.
- Scenario data model is **chief + deputies**. The catalog browser is the
  primary composition path (click satellite → add to scenario). See
  Decisions 13, 14.
- Build professional-grade from day one — auth pipeline real (stub
  initially), `scenario.owner` exists from the first migration, scenario
  mutations go through one service layer, propagation is deterministic
  (seeded + pinned). See Decision 16.
- TypeScript strict mode on. Never disable.
- Per-slice Zustand subscriptions.

## Conventions
- Ask before adding dependencies.
- Commit after each working feature.
- Tag frame in code wherever state vectors live (names, types, comments):
  `ECI` / `ECEF` / `LVLH` / `RIC` / `body`.

## Build commands

### Full stack (Docker Compose)
- `docker compose up -d --build` — backend + Postgres + frontend (build on first run).
- `docker compose down` — stop services (preserves db volume).
- `docker compose down -v` — stop and wipe db.
- Backend: http://localhost:8081  ·  Frontend: http://localhost:5174
  (host ports 8080 / 5173 are taken by other services on this shared box).

### Frontend (`frontend/`)
- `npm run dev` — Vite dev server on port 5173 (inside container; 5174 from host).
- `npm run type-check` — `tsc --noEmit`.
- `npm run gen:api` — regenerate the OpenAPI client from the running backend.
- **When `package.json` changes**, rebuild the image AND drop the anon volume
  or the container keeps stale deps. See "dep-change workflow" in
  [frontend/README.md](frontend/README.md). The browser-facing API base is
  `/api` (proxied by Vite to the backend); never use absolute backend URLs in
  client code.

### Backend (`backend/`) — Gradle, Spring Boot 3.5, Java 21
- `./gradlew bootRun` — start backend locally (requires local JDK 21 + a Postgres reachable at $DB_URL).
- `./gradlew build` — full build incl. tests.
- `./gradlew build -x test` — build without tests (faster, no DB needed).
- Set `JAVA_HOME=$HOME/jdk-21.0.11+10` and prepend to `PATH` (already in `~/.bashrc`).

### Stack (TBD — Phase 1)
- `docker compose up` — full local dev environment (frontend + backend + db).
